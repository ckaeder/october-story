Once upon a time there was a town called A.

There is a guy named B in town A.
B was really happy to be living in town A. Until...
A murderer came and visited all of the people in the town. 
When it was B's turn to get visited he opened the door with a grin on his face.
The murderer was his friend who was now reformed by the prison system and ready to live a responsible life.
B said: It's a been a long time my friend.
B welcomed his friend in to dinner and they discussed how he had visited those whose families he had wronged to make ammends. They then turned towards discussing their futures. 

Fin.
